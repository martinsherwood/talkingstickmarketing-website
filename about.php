                            <p>Talking Stick is an unusual name for a unique company. Our ancient forefathers often met around the fire to debate and discuss the issues of the time. To avoid the gatherings descending into chaos with everyone speaking at once, the "stick" was introduced to control debate. He who held the “stick” held the sacred power of words and nobody could speak unless they were holding the “stick”. The “Talking Stick” was born and thereafter became the most powerful communications tool of its’ time. Although times have changed, chaotic debates are still commonplace, with new sales and marketing electronic spam clogging channels and messages becoming increasingly difficult to get across. However, our philosophy at Talking Stick Marketing, is to gain control of the “Talking Stick” and hold onto it for the benefit of our clients, ensuring that we deliver your message clearly, consistently and without interruptions.</p>
